/**
 * An interface to create nonce identifiers for StealthNet packets. This is used
 * to prevent message replay attacks by "generating" and "consuming" nonces.
 * 
 * A nonce is stored as a byte array of 8 bytes. When a packet is sent, a nonce
 * is generated and appended to the message. At the receiving end of the
 * communications, the peer is able to check if a message with the received
 * nonce has been received before. If yes, then this packet is probably a
 * replay, and is consequently discarded silently.
