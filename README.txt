EXECUTABLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three executables resulting from the StealthNet package. These are as
follows:

- Client
    A StealthNet client instance. This is a GUI application that allows users to
    chat and share files.
- Server
    A StealthNet server instance. This is a command-line application that is 
    used to co-ordinate StealthNet clients.
- Proxy
    A StealthNet proxy instance. In its default form, this application is a 
    transparent layer (man-in-the-middle) that transparently relays messages
    between clients and servers. The proxy can additionally be used to simulate
    various security attacks.
